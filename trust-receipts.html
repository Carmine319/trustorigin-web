  <h1>Trust Receipts</h1>

  <!-- LEGAL INTERPRETATION BOUNDARY (DO NOT MOVE) -->
  <p>
    Trust Receipts are descriptive records of declaration and time.
    They do not represent certification, correctness, legality, or compliance.
    Interpretation is the responsibility of the recipient.
  </p>

  <h2>What a Trust Receipt Is</h2>

  <p>
    A Trust Receipt is a structured record issued by the TrustOrigin system
    following the declaration of a digital artefact.
  </p>

  <p>
    It records:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The declared artefact identifier</li>
    <li>The cryptographic hash of the artefact at declaration time</li>
    <li>The timestamp of declaration</li>
    <li>The declared scope and context</li>
    <li>The artefact’s declared temporal lineage</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What a Trust Receipt Is Not</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A certificate</li>
    <li>A validation of accuracy or truth</li>
    <li>A statement of legality or compliance</li>
    <li>An endorsement or approval</li>
    <li>A judgement of safety, quality, or fitness</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Evidentiary Framing</h2>

  <p>
    Trust Receipts provide evidence that a declaration occurred at a specific
    point in time, under a stated scope, using a defined artefact state.
  </p>

  <p>
    They do not determine how that evidence should be interpreted or relied upon.
    Any use of a Trust Receipt is contextual and remains the responsibility of
    the relying party.
