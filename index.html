    <h1>TrustOrigin</h1>

    <p>
        TrustOrigin is a neutral declarative governance infrastructure designed to record structured institutional statements 
        relating to digital artefacts, AI system usage, vendor dependency exposure, and operational continuity posture.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system provides time-anchored, cryptographically hashed, version-controlled records without introducing 
        certification, validation, or adjudication authority.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Core Institutional Function</h2>

    <p>
        Modern organisations operate within layered technical dependency environments. 
        AI systems influence outputs. External vendors introduce infrastructure reliance. 
        Artefacts evolve across versions. Migration risk accumulates silently.
    </p>

    <p>
        TrustOrigin records declarative governance objects addressing these structural exposures.
        It does not replace operational systems. It records statements about them.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Artefact Registration Layer</h2>

    <p>
        Digital artefacts may be registered through a structured declaration process.
        Each registration produces:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Declared artefact identifier</li>
        <li>Cryptographic hash at declaration time</li>
        <li>UTC timestamp of record creation</li>
        <li>Declared scope and contextual metadata</li>
        <li>Version relationship mapping</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The system generates a Trust Receipt reflecting the existence of the declaration.
        A Trust Receipt is not a certificate and does not imply authenticity or ownership.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>AI System Declaration Objects</h2>

    <p>
        Organisations may record structured declarations relating to AI system usage within operational workflows.
        These declarations may include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Model name and version</li>
        <li>Hosting provider</li>
        <li>Declared data category</li>
        <li>Human oversight status</li>
        <li>Synthetic output flag</li>
        <li>Jurisdiction reference</li>
        <li>Internal policy linkage</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The objective is not compliance certification. The objective is continuity documentation.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Vendor Dependency & Migration Continuity</h2>

    <p>
        External vendor reliance introduces structural exposure across infrastructure, cloud, data, and AI providers.
        TrustOrigin enables the recording of vendor dependency declarations and migration readiness posture statements.
    </p>

    <p>
        These records assist institutions in documenting:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Primary system dependencies</li>
        <li>Exit-readiness status</li>
        <li>Data portability considerations</li>
        <li>Declared recovery planning posture</li>
        <li>Continuity documentation references</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        TrustOrigin does not execute migrations, store production datasets, or intervene operationally.
        It records declared governance states at defined points in time.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Institutional Design Principles</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Neutral recording infrastructure</li>
        <li>Declarative-only architecture</li>
        <li>No certification authority</li>
        <li>No legal assessment functionality</li>
        <li>No validation or adjudication</li>
        <li>Version permanence and freeze capability</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>System Output</h2>

    <p>
        All outputs are issued as Trust Receipts.
        A Trust Receipt is a descriptive record of declaration and time.
        It does not represent certification, legality, correctness, or compliance.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Operational Boundary</h2>

    <p>
        TrustOrigin does not:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Verify artefacts</li>
        <li>Assess regulatory compliance</li>
        <li>Determine legality</li>
        <li>Certify systems</li>
        <li>Resolve disputes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        It records structured statements and preserves their existence.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Institutional Evaluation Access</h2>

    <p>
        Organisations seeking structured pilot evaluation access may request controlled onboarding.
        Pilot access does not constitute licence, entitlement, or contractual commit
