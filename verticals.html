    <h1>TrustOrigin Verticals</h1>

    <p>
        TrustOrigin verticals are modular declarative governance interfaces built upon a single neutral registry core.
        Each vertical defines a contextual application layer without introducing validation authority, adjudication,
        certification, or regulatory judgement.
    </p>

    <p>
        All vertical implementations operate within the same structural boundaries:
        declarative recording only, time anchoring, version control, and cryptographic integrity preservation.
    </p>

    <h2>Synthetic Media & AI Declarations</h2>

    <p>
        Structured recording of declarations relating to AI-assisted, synthetic, or composite digital artefacts.
        This vertical enables organisations to document the contextual parameters surrounding AI system usage.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Model identification and version reference</li>
        <li>Hosting and infrastructure provider disclosure</li>
        <li>Declared training data category</li>
        <li>Human oversight posture statement</li>
        <li>Synthetic output designation</li>
        <li>Jurisdictional scope reference</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This vertical does not detect, classify, verify, or authenticate content.
        It records structured institutional declarations.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>AutoEvidence – Structured Evidentiary Intake</h2>

    <p>
        Chronological declarative recording framework for compliance documentation,
        dispute readiness, audit preparation, and institutional continuity structuring.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Evidence reference identifiers</li>
        <li>Time-anchored submission logging</li>
        <li>Declared contextual scope</li>
        <li>Hash-based artefact reference integrity</li>
        <li>Version lineage mapping</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This vertical does not assess admissibility, truth, or legal sufficiency.
        It preserves declared existence and structure.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Vendor Dependency & Exit-Readiness Documentation</h2>

    <p>
        Structured declarations relating to external infrastructure reliance,
        cloud service exposure, API dependency chains, and third-party AI integration.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Primary vendor identification</li>
        <li>Service layer categorisation</li>
        <li>Declared migration readiness posture</li>
        <li>Data portability statement</li>
        <li>Continuity documentation linkage</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This vertical does not execute migrations, enforce portability,
        or evaluate contractual obligations.
        It records declared institutional posture at a defined moment in time.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Artefact Lifecycle Governance</h2>

    <p>
        Declarative tracking of digital artefact evolution across versions,
        including structured temporal lineage mapping.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Initial declaration reference</li>
        <li>Successive version identifiers</li>
        <li>Hash continuity mapping</li>
        <li>Freeze event documentation</li>
        <li>Immutable historical preservation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This vertical supports institutional documentation discipline
        without introducing certification authority.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Cloud Access Layer (Future Institutional Deployment)</h2>

    <p>
        Controlled enterprise access interfaces may be provisioned for structured deployment,
        including private registry partitions and institutional access segregation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Cloud-based automation, APIs, and continuous execution are not enabled
        during pilot phase evaluation.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Commercial Deployment Framework</h2>

    <p>
        Vertical implementations may be licensed individually or as bundled governance infrastructure packages.
        Licensing structures are defined separately within the commercial framework.
