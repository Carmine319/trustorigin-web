  <h1>How TrustOrigin Works</h1>

  <p>
    TrustOrigin operates as a neutral recording infrastructure.
    It records declarations about digital artefacts at specific points in time,
    together with cryptographic hashes and declared context.
  </p>

  <h2>Declaration</h2>
  <p>
    A declaring party submits an artefact identifier, hash, scope, and lineage
    information. TrustOrigin records this declaration without evaluating its
    correctness, accuracy, legality, or meaning.
  </p>

  <h2>Recording</h2>
  <p>
    Each declaration is timestamped and preserved in an immutable record.
    Previous states are never overwritten or removed.
  </p>

  <h2>Trust Receipts</h2>
  <p>
    A Trust Receipt may be generated to document that a declaration occurred
    at a specific time under a stated scope.
    Trust Receipts do not constitute certification, validation, or endorsement.
  </p>

  <h2>Interpretation</h2>
  <p>
    Interpretation of any record or receipt remains the responsibility of
    the relying party. TrustOrigin does not provide judgements or conclusions.
