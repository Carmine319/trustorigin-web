  <!-- LEGAL INTERPRETATION BOUNDARY (DO NOT MOVE) -->
  <p>
    TrustOrigin governance artefacts are versioned, hashed, and frozen.
    The freeze records the governance state at a point in time.
    It does not constitute approval, certification, or validation.
  </p>

  <!-- FREEZE NOTICE -->
  <h2>Governance Freeze Notice</h2>

  <p>
    The governance artefacts governing the TrustOrigin system were formally
    frozen on <strong>2026-01-05 at 11:45 UTC</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This freeze applies to the governance documents and schemas listed in the
    TrustOrigin Governance Hash Registry v1.0.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the freeze time forward:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>No listed artefact is modified or replaced.</li>
    <li>Any amendment requires a new, versioned artefact and a new registry.</li>
    <li>Historical versions remain permanently accessible.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This notice records the existence of the freeze.
    It does not imply certification, endorsement, validation, or assessment
